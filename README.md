# Yex

<!-- MDOC -->

`yex` is a Elixir port of `yrs`, a Rust library that has tools for making CRDTs easier to work with.
It's a work in progress and not ready for production use yet!.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `yex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:yex, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
